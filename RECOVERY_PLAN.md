## Immediate Next Steps

If you choose the rewrite approach:

1. **Week 1 Day 1**: Create new git branch `rewrite-foundation`
2. **Week 1 Day 1**: Set up basic project structure with minimal dependencies
3. **Week 1 Day 2**: Implement simplest possible MDX parser using basic regex patterns
4. **Week 1 Day 3**: Create basic transformer that handles Test Case 1
5. **Week 1 Day 4**: Add simple DAX generator for measure-only queries
6. **Week 1 Day 5**: Ensure Test Case 1 passes with real functional test

**Key Principle**: Every day should end with working, tested functionality that demonstrates progress toward the final goal.

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **1 Senior Developer**: Architecture and core implementation
- **1 Junior Developer**: Testing and documentation
- **1 Part-time QA**: Integration testing and validation

### Infrastructure
- **Power BI License**: For DAX validation testing
- **Oracle Essbase Access**: For real-world MDX samples
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated testing and deployment

### Budget Estimate
- **Development**: 12 weeks × 2.5 developers = 30 developer-weeks
- **Infrastructure**: Power BI, CI/CD, testing tools
- **Total**: Approximately $50,000-$75,000 for complete rewrite

## Conclusion

The current UnMDX project is unsalvageable in its current form. However, the core concept is sound and the business need is real. A complete rewrite following this recovery plan would result in a production-ready MDX-to-DAX converter that actually works.

The key to success is starting with working functionality for simple cases and incrementally adding complexity, rather than trying to build a perfect architecture that doesn't work.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with the complete rewrite approach, starting immediately with Phase 1 Week 1 tasks.
