# MDX to DAX Converter - Project Plan

## Project Overview

### Goal

Build a comprehensive Python package that converts MDX queries (particularly messy output from Necto SSAS cubes) into clean, optimized DAX queries with human-readable explanations. The package should be reusable across multiple projects and applications.

### Key Components

1. **MDX Parser** - Lark-based parser for handling poorly formatted MDX
1. **Intermediate Representation (IR)** - Normalized semantic representation
1. **Linter** - Cleans and optimizes the parsed MDX structure
1. **DAX Generator** - Produces clean DAX queries from IR
1. **SQL Explainer** - Generates human-readable explanations

### Technical Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Lark for parsing
- Textual for CLI interface
- Pydantic for data models
- Pytest for testing
- Black/Ruff for code quality

└──────────────────┘ - Individual functions
                     - Class methods
                     - Edge cases
```

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementation
1. **Fixture Management** - Centralized test data in `tests/fixtures/`
1. **Mocking Strategy** - Mock external dependencies only
1. **Coverage Requirements** - Minimum 90% overall, 100% for critical paths
1. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark against baseline metrics
1. **Error Testing** - Every error path must have a test

### Continuous Testing

- Pre-commit hooks run unit tests
- PR checks run full test suite
- Nightly builds run performance tests
- Weekly runs of property-based tests
- Monthly security vulnerability scans

-----

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Lark Performance** - Mitigate with grammar optimization and caching
1. **Complex Hierarchies** - Extensive test cases, fallback strategies
1. **DAX Compatibility** - Validate against Power BI, iterate based on feedback

### Testing Risks

1. **Test Maintenance** - Use fixtures and factories to minimize duplication
1. **Flaky Tests** - Identify and fix non-deterministic tests immediately
1. **Coverage Gaps** - Weekly coverage reviews, mutation testing

-----

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**
- Test coverage > 90%
- Zero critical bugs in production
- All linting rules pass
1. **Performance**
- Parse 1000-line MDX query < 1 second
- Generate DAX < 100ms after parsing
- Memory usage < 500MB for large queries
1. **User Satisfaction**
- Clear error messages for 100% of invalid queries
- Human-readable output rated “understandable” by SQL users
- Successfully convert 95% of Necto-generated queries
